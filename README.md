## üåü Features & Functionality

EduNews delivers a comprehensive suite of meticulously designed features to ensure a dynamic, secure, and highly efficient news management experience for all its users.

### User-Friendly News Feed
Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a beautifully designed, clean, and highly responsive news feed. This feed presents an infinitely scrollable list of news articles, ensuring continuous access to fresh content without manual refreshes. Each individual article item is thoughtfully designed to provide a concise yet informative overview, including a captivating headline, the precise publication date, a compelling snippet of the article's description, and a thumbnail image.

### Detailed Article View
Tapping on any news article presents the full article content, transforming the screen into an immersive and focused reading experience. This dedicated view supports high-quality, adaptable images that are dynamically adjusted to preserve their original aspect ratio, ensuring clarity and accessibility across a diverse range of Android devices and screen sizes.

### Article Creation
Empowering content creators is a core strength of EduNews. The application offers an intuitive interface for creating new articles. Users can easily enter a title, description, and select the most relevant category from a predefined list. A robust image upload mechanism allows for easy inclusion of visual content, making each article more engaging.

### Post Management (My Posts)
A personalized dashboard allows authenticated users to effortlessly manage their contributions. This dedicated section provides a clear overview of all articles they have published, facilitating easy access for review or further action.

### Intuitive Article Editing
Editing posts is a seamless experience, designed for maximum flexibility:
- **Dual Mode Interface**: Users can fluidly switch between a "View Mode" (for reading) and an "Edit Mode" (for modification) for any of their existing posts.
- **Comprehensive Content Modification**: In "Edit Mode," all core article components‚Äîtitle, description, and category‚Äîbecome fully editable, allowing for quick updates and corrections.
- **Advanced Image Handling**: The app provides intelligent image management. Users can easily replace an existing article image with a new one or opt to clear the image entirely. 
- **Refined Category Selection**: The category dropdown offers a smooth user experience during mode switching.

### Secure Article Deletion
Users have full control over their content, with the ability to permanently delete their own published articles. A clear confirmation prompt precedes any deletion, preventing accidental data loss. The deletion process is comprehensive, safely removing both the article's data from Cloud Firestore and its associated image from Firebase Storage.

### Firebase Integration
The backbone of EduNews is built upon Google Firebase, leveraging its powerful suite of cloud services for a scalable, secure, and real-time backend.

### User Profile Navigation
A readily accessible profile icon in the top navigation bar provides quick access to user-specific information.
